// Short display labels for place names (ADR-0059 §3 amendment).
//
// Google returns a place's full official name — `נמל התעופה הבינלאומי קפלאוויק`,
// `Charles de Gaulle Airport` — and there is NO short-name field to ask for
// instead: `shortFormattedAddress` is an address, `addressComponents[].shortText`
// abbreviates address parts only, and there's no IATA code. (Reading the
// airport's `locality` doesn't work either — Ben Gurion's is "לוד".) So the
// shortening is ours.
//
// The trick is that the length comes from **generic category words**, not from
// the distinctive part of the name. So we enumerate the noise, never the places:
// this list grows with how many KINDS of place exist (airport, train station,
// bus terminal), not with how many places exist. Stripping `נמל התעופה` turns
// `נמל התעופה בן גוריון` into `בן גוריון` without knowing anything about Ben
// Gurion — and the same nine patterns handle Keflavík, Narita, Haneda, Charles
// de Gaulle and Amsterdam Central.
//
// Three properties this deliberately keeps:
//   • Display-only. `Place.name` is untouched, so the full name still shows in
//     the booking detail and as a tooltip, and nothing here needs a migration.
//   • Never destructive. If stripping leaves nothing real (the name WAS the
//     category phrase, or less than MIN_LABEL_CHARS remains), the original is
//     returned unchanged.
//   • Fails to "no change", never to a wrong name. A category phrase we haven't
//     listed — or a name in a script we have no patterns for (東京駅) — simply
//     displays in full, exactly as it does today.
//
// It deliberately does NOT produce colloquial abbreviations (`נתב״ג`): those need
// a per-place dictionary, which is what a user-set place nickname is for.

/** Shortest remainder we'll accept — below this the strip clearly ate the name. */
