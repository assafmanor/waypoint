description: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance (Vercel's accessibility, focus, forms, motion, typography and performance rules, fetched from a pinned commit). Use when asked to "review my UI", "check accessibility", "audit design", "review UX", or "check my site against best practices", and on any frontend/ or mockups/ change before calling it done. Where a rule assumes an English, desktop or hover-first page - curly quotes, hover-only feedback, LTR - root CLAUDE.md, design-language.md and the RTL rules win.

# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/e3d624baaf29dc1fc645aff3e38f03e564d2d6b1/command.md
```

Use WebFetch to retrieve the latest rules. The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
